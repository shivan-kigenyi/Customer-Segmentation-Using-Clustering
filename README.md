# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

This project uses unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to segment mall customers based on demographic and behavioral data such as age, income, and spending score.

The aim is to uncover distinct customer profiles for better targeting and decision-making.

## Project Objective
To segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographic and behavioral pattern, enabling business to:
- Tailor marketing strategies
- Improve customer experience 
- Maximize profits by targeting high-value customer groups

Key Research Questions
1. "How can we group similar customers together based on thier behavior and demographics?"
2. "What are the defining features of each customer group(cluster)?"
3. "Which customer segments are high-value(e.g high spenders or loyal customers)?"
4. "How can the business use these segments to improve decision-making?"

## Project workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data (Handle missing values , fix categorical issues)
3. Perform exploratory data analysis(EDA)
4. Apply K-means Clustering
5. Evaluate and visualize the clusters
6. Interprete the business value of each segment

## Tools and Technologies
Python (Pandas, Matplotlit, Numpy, Seaborn)
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

## Key Finding (to be edited)
Identified 4 customer segments with distinct behaviors
- Segment 1: Young, high spenders with moderate income
- Segment 2: Older, high-income but low spenders
- Segment 3: Low-income, high-spending (possibly risky)
- Segment 4: Average spenders and earners â€“ steady customers
